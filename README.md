## Documentation

## Deployment

Download [the latest walrus binary](https://github.com/Clivern/Walrus/releases). Make it executable from everywhere.

```zsh
$ curl -sL https://github.com/Clivern/Walrus/releases/download/x.x.x/walrus_x.x.x_OS.tar.gz | tar xz
```


#### To run walrus as a tower:

Create the tower configs file `tower.config.yml` from `config.dist.yml`. Something like the following:

```yaml
# Tower configs
tower:
    # Env mode (dev or prod)
    mode: ${WALRUS_APP_MODE:-dev}
    # HTTP port
    port: ${WALRUS_API_PORT:-8080}
    # TLS configs
    tls:
        status: ${WALRUS_API_TLS_STATUS:-off}
        pemPath: ${WALRUS_API_TLS_PEMPATH:-cert/server.pem}
        keyPath: ${WALRUS_API_TLS_KEYPATH:-cert/server.key}

    # Message Broker Configs
    broker:
        # Broker driver (native)
        driver: ${WALRUS_BROKER_DRIVER:-native}
        # Native driver configs
        native:
            # Queue max capacity
            capacity: ${WALRUS_BROKER_NATIVE_CAPACITY:-5000}
            # Number of concurrent workers
            workers: ${WALRUS_BROKER_NATIVE_WORKERS:-4}

    # API Configs
    api:
        key: ${WALRUS_API_KEY:- }
        encryptionKey: ${WALRUS_ENCRYPTION_KEY:- }

    # Runtime, Requests/Response and Walrus Metrics
    metrics:
        prometheus:
            # Route for the metrics endpoint
            endpoint: ${WALRUS_METRICS_PROM_ENDPOINT:-/metrics}

    # Application Database
    database:
        # Database driver (sqlite3, mysql)
        driver: ${WALRUS_DATABASE_DRIVER:-sqlite3}
        # Hostname
        host: ${WALRUS_DATABASE_MYSQL_HOST:-localhost}
        # Port
        port: ${WALRUS_DATABASE_MYSQL_PORT:-3306}
        # Database
        name: ${WALRUS_DATABASE_MYSQL_DATABASE:-walrus.db}
        # Username
        username: ${WALRUS_DATABASE_MYSQL_USERNAME:-root}
        # Password
        password: ${WALRUS_DATABASE_MYSQL_PASSWORD:-root}

    # Log configs
    log:
        # Log level, it can be debug, info, warn, error, panic, fatal
        level: ${WALRUS_LOG_LEVEL:-info}
        # output can be stdout or abs path to log file /var/logs/walrus.log
        output: ${WALRUS_LOG_OUTPUT:-stdout}
        # Format can be json
        format: ${WALRUS_LOG_FORMAT:-json}
```

The run the `tower` with `systemd`

```
walrus tower -c /path/to/tower.config.yml
```


#### To run walrus as an agent:

Create the agent configs file `agent.config.yml` from `config.dist.yml`. Something like the following:

```yaml
# Agent configs
agent:
    # Env mode (dev or prod)
    mode: ${WALRUS_APP_MODE:-dev}
    # HTTP port
    port: ${WALRUS_API_PORT:-8081}
    # TLS configs
    tls:
        status: ${WALRUS_API_TLS_STATUS:-off}
        pemPath: ${WALRUS_API_TLS_PEMPATH:-cert/server.pem}
        keyPath: ${WALRUS_API_TLS_KEYPATH:-cert/server.key}

    # Message Broker Configs
    broker:
        # Broker driver (native)
        driver: ${WALRUS_BROKER_DRIVER:-native}
        # Native driver configs
        native:
            # Queue max capacity
            capacity: ${WALRUS_BROKER_NATIVE_CAPACITY:-5000}
            # Number of concurrent workers
            workers: ${WALRUS_BROKER_NATIVE_WORKERS:-4}

    # Tower Configs
    tower:
        url: ${WALRUS_TOWER_URL:-http://127.0.0.1:8080}

        # This must match the one defined in tower config file
        apiKey: ${WALRUS_TOWER_API_KEY:- }

        # This must match the one defined in tower config file
        encryptionKey: ${WALRUS_ENCRYPTION_KEY:- }

    # API Configs
    api:
        key: ${WALRUS_API_KEY:- }

    # Log configs
    log:
        # Log level, it can be debug, info, warn, error, panic, fatal
        level: ${WALRUS_LOG_LEVEL:-info}
        # output can be stdout or abs path to log file /var/logs/walrus.log
        output: ${WALRUS_LOG_OUTPUT:-stdout}
        # Format can be json
        format: ${WALRUS_LOG_FORMAT:-json}
```

The run the `agent` with `systemd`

```
walrus agent -c /path/to/agent.config.yml
```


#### To run the admin dashboard:

Clone the project:

```zsh
$ git clone https://github.com/Clivern/Walrus.git
```

Create the dashboard config file `web/.env` from `web/.env.dist`. Something like the following:

```
VUE_APP_TOWER_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

Then you can either build or run the dashboard

```zsh
$ make serve_ui

$ make build_ui
```
